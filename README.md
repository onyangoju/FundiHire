# 🛠️ FundiHire Group 116

## 🚀 Project Overview

**FundiHire** is a booking platform built during the **Vibe Coding Hackathon 2.0** PLP Bootcamp to bridge the gap between clients and local service providers like fundis, cleaners, and tutors.

> 📱 The goal: Let users **find, book, and pay** trusted fundis and freelancers with ease—either through WhatsApp or a mobile-friendly web app.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Many skilled local service providers lack tools for booking, visibility, and digital payments. As a result, they lose clients and opportunities.

### 🎯 Challenge
Build a system where:
- Clients can discover, book, and pay trusted service providers.
- Fundis can list their services and get visibility.

## 💰 Monetization Ideas

- Weekly listing fee for fundis (KES 50–200).
- Commission per job/lead.
- Integrate M-Pesa for easy mobile payments.
